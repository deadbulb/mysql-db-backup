mysql-db-backup
===============

Script for backing up a MySQL Database with different options

Motivation
----------

The impact of dumping my databases caused service outages be-
cause the load of dumping was too high. So this script offers
several ways to reduce load at dumping the databases.

Features
--------

- Use "nice" for CPU throttling
- Use "ionice" for I/O throttling
- Use "cstream" for mysqldump bandwidth limitation
- Use "split" for dump file splitting.
- Use compression with xz/bzip2/gzip
- Exclude databases
- Logging / Debugging

Requirements
------------

Install the tools mentioned above for the features
to work. If not available backup will be done with-
out these tools if possible.

Databases to be backed up should use InnoDB-Storage-
Engine(should be default). With MyISAM, I think, dumps
are not consistent.

Installation and Usage
----------------------

- Copy this script to your system and set +x bit.
- Review the config part at the top of the script and
  configure it to your needs
- Let cron call the script, at a time that is convenient
  for you
- Create the password file with the password corres-
  ponding to the username you configured in the script,
  like this:

--- /root/.my.cnf.save -------

[client]
password="yourbackupoperatorpasswordhere"

--- /root/.my.cnf.save END ---

Further notes
-------------

Split is used because it may give you advantages 
with your backup handling. Files are split into
small pieces, so there is a chance, that one or
more files having unchanged content and maybe 
you do not have to back it up because of that.
